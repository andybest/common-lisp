* GfxMath

** About

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
GfxMath is a math library primarily for game development and graphical simulations, with a focus on correctness, extensibility, and simplicity (in that order) over performance.

It provides a type hierarchy for matrices, vectors, and quaternions which can be used to perform geometrical calculations useful for graphical applications, such as interfacing with OpenGL.

It takes a unique and somewhat opinionated approach to overcome some difficulties that we have encountered as game developers.

** Rationale

GfxMath was written to favor an extensible and more maintainable generic function protocol over the approach by some other libraries, such as [[https://github.com/mfiano/origin][origin]], that split types and the functions operating on them into separate packages.

Additionally, in contrast to some other libraries, GfxMath favors simplicity, which also aids in maintainability. This is accomplished by a =define-op= macro that all operations are defined with, and macros for iterating over the various shapes of the aggregate math types. The expansion of =define-op= defines a generic function, all applicable methods matching the rules of a custom lambda list that is parsed, as well as automatically generated documentation strings for the methods, by means of a simple templating text pre-processor with knowledge of the custom lambda list for emitting friendly names of the types it describes. With such an extensive array of mathematical operations, keeping the library small and maintainable was one of our primary objectives, and =define-op= was our solution.

Also to aid in simplicity, we roll the implementation of nearly all operations in loops, as opposed to some other libraries that manually, or by means of a macro, unroll loop operations. Again, this is to keep the codebase at a maintainable size. A notable exception is 4x4 matrix inversion, in which we take the approach of a macro generating the piles of code.

Finally, GfxMath attempts to solve a real problem we've encountered in our work in the field of game development. Single-precision floating point operations just do not have enough bits in their representation to apply a chain of operations before the end result is uploaded to the GPU. Using double-precision floating point values in the underlying storage of the math types means that we have to coerce many arrays to single-precision floating point values many times per frame in a graphical application, because it is a widely known fact that using double-precision floating point values on the GPU is a serious performance trap. To combat this conundrum, all math types are objects wrapping both a double-precision and single-precision floating point array. All operations use the double-precision array for its extra guard bits to reduce numerical error, and the single-precision floating point array remains initialized to all zero values until explicitly asked to be filled with the values of the double-precision array with the =to-array= or =to-array!= generic functions when supplied a =:single-float= keyword argument. This is space trade-off we are willing to make, as it reduces precision issues with long chains of operations susceptible to numerical error, and the extra space in system memory is rarely ever an issue, as there will likely be a scarcity of available GPU memory long before system memory.

** Versioning

This software follows [[https://semver.org/][Semantic Versioning]]. The version number does not reflect any level of stability, and instead signifies the API compatibility to consumers of the library. It is recommended that consumers of GfxMath use [[https://www.clpm.dev][CLPM]] in order to depend on a specific API. If instead you prefer Quicklisp, just note that commits made to the master branch of this repository which Quicklisp tracks do not have any guarantee of stability or API compatibility.

** Usage

To use this library, add it as a dependency to your [[https://www.clpm.dev][CLPM]] manifest file and load the =:gfxmath= system with =asdf:load-system=. Quicklisp users can also clone this repository to their =local-projects= directory and load the system with it. The former is recommended to maintain API compatibility.

The complete API reference with all documentation strings is not included in this README, as it would be quite lengthy. Instead, one can use Common Lisp's =apropos= functionality to search for operations. All constructors are conveniently prefixed with =make-=. To list all constructors as an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
(apropos "make" :gfxmath t)
#+END_SRC

After finding an interesting function, you can view the documentation of all associated methods with =describe=. The following shows the documentation of all methods with the =*= (multiplication) operator:

Note that if browsing the source code to discover the available functionality or documentation, =define-op= is a macro that expands to possibly multiple methods each with a specific documentation string.

** Limitations

- Some operations on matrices require knowledge of their intended use. For example, retrieving the scale of a 3x3 matrix is meaningless, as it must be known whether the matrix represents a 2-dimensional transformation matrix or a 3-dimensional rotation matrix. Support for context-aware matrices is a planned feature for v1.0.0.

** Unit Tests

GfxMath includes a suite of approximately 900 unit tests that cover the full range of the supported mathematical operations. To run them all, do the following:

If using Quicklisp, first ensure you have [[https://github.com/fukamachi/prove][prove]] installed with:

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
(ql:quickload :prove)
#+END_SRC

Then, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
(asdf:test-system :gfxmath)
#+END_SRC
